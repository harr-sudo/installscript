# Why

I got tired of having to manually install tools for each new build of kali so I wrote a quick script which pulls some of my most common tools. 


# Getting Started

This script is designed to be run on a fresh install of Kali. I have tested it on Kali 2022.4 VMWare.
See https://github.com/harr-sudo/installscript/blob/main/install.sh for full list of tools.   



# Oneliner:

sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harr-sudo/installscript/main/install.sh && chmod +x ./install.sh && ./install.sh
